#Writing Scientific Software

This is a presentation on techniques and design patterns for
scientific software. It is based off of the book
[Scientific Software Design: The Object-Oriented Way](http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/engineering/engineering-general-interest/scientific-software-design-object-oriented-way)
by Rouson, Xia, and Xu. It is aimed at an audience with experiencing
writing scientific code, but who aren't necessarily well versed in
object oriented programming or best practice for programming.
